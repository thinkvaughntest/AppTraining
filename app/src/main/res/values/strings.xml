    <string name="firstMessage">There are many things you should learn about Android App development.
    There will be no way to learn them from this short training class. There is a copy of the basic code you will need
        for this training class at a git repository. If you know how to use git you can clone that and open the project
        in android studio, or if you are a genius you can do it all from the command line.

       \n\n Oh yeah. Here is the link to the github code for this project. If you want to know how to add a hyper link
        in your string then all you have to do is add this android:autoLink="web" in the textview element that references your
        string. :)
